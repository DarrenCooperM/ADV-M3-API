For each character, the loop adds the character's ASCII value to a running total called value, after
first subtracting the ASCII value of "A" and adding 1. This has the effect of summing up the positions
of the letters in the model string, with "A" being assigned a value of 1 and "Z" being assigned a value of 26.
